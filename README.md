# 🗺️ U.S. States Guessing Game

This is an interactive **U.S. States Guessing Game** built using **Python's Turtle module** and **Pandas**. The game displays a blank U.S. map and prompts the player to guess state names. If the guessed state is correct, its name appears at the correct location on the map. The goal is to identify all 50 states before running out of attempts.

## 🎮 How the Game Works:
1. A blank U.S. map is displayed.
2. The player is asked to input the name of a U.S. state.
3. If the guessed state is correct, its name is displayed on the map at its correct coordinates.
4. The game continues until:
   - The player finds all 50 states.
   - The player runs out of attempts.
   - The player types **"Exit"** or **"Close"**.
5. At the end of the game, a CSV file (`Remaining_States_to_Learn.csv`) is created containing the names of the states that were not guessed.
